## Response:

The agent successfully reviewed the planning artifacts and documented five architecturally significant decisions as ADRs:

-   ADR-0001: Frontend Technology Stack
-   ADR-0002: Backend Technology Stack & ORM
-   ADR-0003: Database System
-   ADR-0004: Authentication and Authorization Strategy
-   ADR-0005: Testing Strategy

All ADRs include context, decision, consequences (positive and negative), alternatives considered, and references to relevant planning documents. No conflicts with existing ADRs were found.
