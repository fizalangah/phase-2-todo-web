Create a development plan for Phase 1 of my project: In-Memory Python Todo CLI Application.

Requirements for the plan:
1. Include all tasks to implement the Basic Level features:
   - Add Task
   - Update Task
   - Delete Task
   - View Tasks
   - Mark Complete/Incomplete
2. Break tasks into clear, actionable steps for a developer.
3. Specify the folder structure for each task:
   - /models → Task model
   - /services → TaskService methods (add, update, delete, view, complete)
   - main.py → CLI loop
4. Include unit testing tasks for each service method.
5. Mention Spec-Kit Plus integration tasks:
   - Creating spec files in /specs
   - Linking each task to a spec
6. Include a final testing and review task for the entire CLI.
7. Keep it strictly for Phase 1 (no databases, APIs, or future-phase features).

Output Format:
- Step number
- Task description
- Folder/file target
- Notes if needed
